# GitHub Introduction Assignment

## Description
This repository was created for a GitHub collaboration practice assignment.  
It contains a shell script and documentation explaining how to run it and what the expected behavior is.

## Requirements
- Linux, macOS, or Windows with Git Bash / WSL
- Bash shell

## How to Run the Script

1. Open a terminal in the repository folder.

2. (First time only) Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x repo_script-1.sh
```

3. Run the script:
```
./repo_script-1.sh
```

Alternative command:
```
bash repo_script-1.sh
```

## Expected Output
When the script runs successfully, it will print the requested message to the terminal (for example: `Hello World`).

## Notes
- The script must be run from inside the repository directory.
- If permission is denied, run the `chmod +x repo_script-1.sh` command again.
